## Involvement
- Lighting Design
  - Philips color kinetc lights were used to highlight Fishbug's features. A custom python wrapper was used to control the lights via OSC messages were read from the mapping software to tigger color changes in sync with the local environment.
- Spherical Projection Mapping
  - My first chance to play with projection mapping! Two projectors were used with [HeavyM](www.heavym.net) to map the inside of Fishbug's fiberglass head. Then the various patterns were synchronized with the surrouding auditory environment to trigger various effects.
  - My work at 3Scan revolves around the digital recontruction of various biological matter, this lead me to play a recent visualization of the vascular system of a rat's brain inside of fishbugs head.
