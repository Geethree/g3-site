*When the swiss and americans collide and decide to throw down in Tankwa Town*

## Involvement
- Electrical Design
  - Sourcing and rental of a generator
  - Trenching plan to the structures
  - Sound system wiring
- Lighting Design
  - Philip's color kinetics for each structure, all wirelessly networked, controlled from the DJ booth via custom python hooks.
- Mechanical Design
  - Rotating lights... this was Africa so sourcing things is difficult. I found a disco ball motors, some square mirrors and welded up a frame to connect them all together. Then simple 120v LED spot lights were aimed up at the rotating structure
- Network Design
  - Ubiquiti equipment throughout creating a wireless network between each of the structures. As a bonus, the main lighthouse was hooked into the events wifi allowing me to control the lights from anywhere at the event!
