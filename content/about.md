Hello, I'm Gerald.
Professionally, I'm a mechanical engineer that is passionate about fluids, thermo, mechanical design and the interaction of hardware and software. The several past years have been spent flexing my technical managerial skills, by leading a small interdisciplinary team ranging from hardware to devops to build out a digital pathology production line. 

For fun I utilize my technical training to help various arts groups achieve their dreams. A role that normally involves complex integration of hardware, electronics and software to acheive the lead artists vision.  Namely, I sit on the board of the [Flux Foundation](www.fluxfoundation.org) where we use the creation of public art as a vessel to empower the volunteers that join us.
