Hello, I'm Gerald.
Professionally, I'm a mechanical engineer that is passionate about fluids, thermo, mechanical design and the interaction of hardware and software. The past several years have been spent flexing my technical managerial skills at [3Scan](http://www.3scan.com), by leading a small interdisciplinary team ranging from hardware and software engineers to biologists in building out a digital pathology production line. 

For fun, I utilize my technical training to help various arts groups achieve their dreams. A role that normally involves complex integration of hardware, electronics and software to acheive the lead artists vision.  Namely, I sit on the board of the [Flux Foundation](http://www.fluxfoundation.org) where we use the creation of public art as a vessel to empower the volunteers that join us.
