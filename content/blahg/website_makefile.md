Computers and software are wonderful things, instead of remembering to:
- Install node packages
- Compile css
- Generate the resume pdf
- Compile the static hugo site
- Add all of the changed files to the git repo
- Insert a helpful commit message to remember the work done
- Push the changes to master

I'd rather automate that process with a *Makefile* so it happens repeatably each time.
