I'll be honest, I hate maintaiting my resume and CV. There is something about opening *your editor of choice* fiddling with parameters, saving as a PDF, naming the file and uploading it somewhere that requires too many steps. It sure would be nice if we could use MarkDown to generate a PDF automagically whenever I press a new version of this website.

[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and [ConText](https://wiki.contextgarden.net/Main_Page) to the rescue!
