      <description>Involvement  Budgeting  Short and sweet: Lighting/Electrical budget was stated for $13k, due to the proliferation of Alibaba and using standardized electrical products, the final budget came in right around $7k.   Lighting design lead  Preliminary ideas required four main rotating lights, with sconces around the exterior of the structures to illuminate the outside. For the main light a discontinued &amp;lsquo;Space Cannon II&amp;rsquo; DMX controlled spotlight was donated to the project from someone in the community.</description>

      <description>Half fish, half bug, fiberglass and a whole lot of steel Involvement  Lighting Design  Philips color kinetc lights were used to highlight Fishbug&#39;s features. A custom python wrapper was used to control the lights via OSC messages were read from the mapping software to tigger color changes in sync with the local environment.   Spherical Projection Mapping  My first chance to play with projection mapping! Two projectors were used with HeavyM to map the inside of Fishbug&#39;s fiberglass head.</description>

Involvement  Electro/Mechanical design  In order to pass both electricity and propane through the central spire&#39;s hub, I designed a joint consisting of a rotary fluid union and an electrical slip ring. This design allowed for up to: 200cfm of propane and 25A @120VAC. Carousel position was captured by creating a custom rotary encoder that consisted of a square tooth gear with two hall-effect sensors 90deg out of phase with one another.</description>
