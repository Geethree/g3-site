      <description>Computers and software are wonderful things, instead of remembering to:
 Ensure all node packages are installed and/or up-to-date Compile css bits Generate the resume: markdown -&amp;gt; laTex -&amp;gt; laTex -&amp;gt; PDF Compile the static hugo site Add all of the changed files to the git repo Insert a helpful commit message to remember the work that was done Push the changes to master  In particular, I always seem to forget step 5 and end up with missing files since everything wasn&amp;rsquo;t appropriately staged before the commit.</description>

      <description> I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest, I hate maintaiting my resume and CV. There is something about opening your editor of choice fiddling with parameters, saving as a PDF, naming the file and uploading it somewhere that requires too many steps. It sure would be nice if we could use MarkDown to generate a PDF automagically whenever I press a new version of this website.
Pandoc and ConText to the rescue!
Markdown -&amp;gt; PDF  Pandoc is used to convert the Markdown file to a latex file ConText is then used to to convert the latex file to a pdf  Markdown -&amp;gt; html  Pandoc and a css style sheet can convert the resume markdown file to an html page  </description>

      <description>Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m Gerald. Professionally, I&amp;rsquo;m a mechanical engineer that is passionate about fluids, thermo, mechanical design and the interaction of hardware and software. The past several years have been spent flexing my technical leadership skills at 3Scan, by leading a small interdisciplinary team ranging from hardware and software engineers to biologists in building out a digital pathology production line. Our work revolves around combining automation, robotics and machine learning to extract spatial data from tissue samples.</description>

      <description>Involvement  Budgeting  Short and sweet: Lighting/Electrical budget was stated for $13k, due to the proliferation of Alibaba and using standardized electrical products, the final budget came in right around $7k.  Lighting design lead  Preliminary ideas required four main rotating lights, with sconces around the exterior of the structures to illuminate the outside. For the main light a discontinued &amp;lsquo;Space Cannon II&amp;rsquo; DMX controlled spotlight was donated to the project from someone in the community.</description>

Involvement  Lighting Design  Philips color kinetc lights were used to highlight Fishbug&amp;rsquo;s features. A custom python wrapper was used to control the lights via OSC messages were read from the mapping software to tigger color changes in sync with the local environment.  Spherical Projection Mapping  My first chance to play with projection mapping! Two projectors were used with HeavyM to map the inside of Fishbug&amp;rsquo;s fiberglass head.</description>

      <description>When the swiss and americans collide and decide to throw down in Tankwa Town Involvement  Electrical Design  Sourcing and rental of a generator Trenching plan to the structures Sound system wiring  Lighting Design  Philip&amp;rsquo;s color kinetics for each structure, all wirelessly networked, controlled from the DJ booth via custom python hooks.  Mechanical Design  Rotating lights&amp;hellip; this was Africa so sourcing things is difficult. I found some disco ball motors in Cape Town, some square mirrors and welded up a frame to connect them all together.</description>

 Involvement  Electro/Mechanical design  In order to pass both electricity and propane through the central spire&amp;rsquo;s hub, I designed a joint consisting of a rotary fluid union and an electrical slip ring. This design allowed for up to: 200cfm of propane and 25A @120VAC.</description>
