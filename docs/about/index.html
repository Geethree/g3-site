        <div class="section" id="content"><p>Hello, I&rsquo;m Gerald!</p>

<p>As a dedicated engineering leader, my passion lies in automation, connected devices, culture, and amplifying my impact by empowering those I collaborate with. My journey has taken me through various roles, including working at <a href="http://www.3scan.com">3Scan</a>, <a href="http://www.strateos.com">Strateos</a>, <a href="http://www.skydio.com">Skydio</a>, and <a href="www.getcruise.com">Cruise</a>.</p>

<p>Over the past decade, I&rsquo;ve showcased my technical leadership at 3Scan by leading a diverse team consisting of hardware and software engineers, as well as biologists, to create a digital pathology production line. Our work involved integrating automation, robotics, and machine learning to derive spatial data from biological tissue samples. I played a pivotal role in designing the mechanical and fluid architecture of our microscopes, scaling our processes, developing and implementing multi-petabyte image acquisition storage systems, and reinforcing our diamond knife supply chain.</p>

<p>In September 2019, 3Scan merged with Transcriptic, forming Strateos. Our mission is to develop the robotic drug discovery factories of the future, transforming laboratories by replacing benchtops with fully automated CloudLabs capable of running biological assays and chemical synthesis. Adapting to a 7-year tech stack, I&rsquo;ve been instrumental in transitioning it to a cloud-native, Kubernetes-first CI/CD system.</p>

<p>Following my experience at Strateos, I joined Skydio as a Site Reliability Engineer, where I played a crucial role in maintaining and optimizing the infrastructure that supports their autonomous drones. My contributions helped enhance the company&rsquo;s growth and enabled seamless scaling of services to accommodate a rapidly expanding user base.</p>

<p>Subsequently, I took on a Site Reliability Engineering role at Cruise, where I was responsible for ensuring the reliability of their self-driving car systems. My work focused on developing efficient solutions to maximize uptime and minimize the risk of failures, contributing to a safer and more sustainable transportation experience.</p>

<p>Outside of my professional life, I enjoy using my technical expertise to support various arts groups in realizing their visions. This often involves intricate integration of hardware, electronics, and software to bring the lead artist&rsquo;s ideas to life. As a board member of the <a href="http://www.fluxfoundation.org">Flux Foundation</a>, we utilize public art creation as a medium to empower volunteers who join us. I am eternally grateful for the opportunities and experiences this organization has provided.</p>
