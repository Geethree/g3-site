	Orthopedics bio-mechanical testing facility working with the medical industry to redesign and improve total knee and hip replacements

	* Validated the improvement of a new method for a tibial tubercle osteotomy
	* Designed a test setup to simulate humans striking their hip during falling in normal gait 

Technical Experience
--------------------

Engineering Management
:   Together we can create something that any individual or single team can imagine!

    * **Agile methodologies**: Applied to both software and hardware
    * **Project management**: From gantt charts and QFDs to task management and KPIs
    * The customer experience is key, dog-fooding is a must
    * Have overseen complex multi-disciplinary teams from 2 to 20 engineers 

Fluidics Design
:   A beautifully complex field that has enabled humans to reach the moon, or replace a worn aortic valve. 

    * **CFD**: Fluent, Solidworks

Mechanical Design
:   Machinist in my heart. Deep knowledge of kinematics, rapid prototyping, Newtonian mechanics, gears, and standardized materials

    * **CAD**: Solidworks, Creo/ProE
    * **FEA**: Abaqus, Solidworks, Creo

Software/System Design
:   Production ready systems should be modular, tested and well documented. Development and Deployments need to be reliable, repeatable and consistently deployed/monitored to ensure there is no drift from code to infrastructure.

	Extensive experience with the following:

    * **Build systems**: Gradle, Maven, Tox
    * **Configuration Management**: Ansible, Puppet, Terraform
    * **Development Environments**: AWS Cloud9, Docker, Vagrant
    * **Languages**: Bash, C, C++, Groovy, Java, .Net, Python, Scala,
    * **Monitoring/Telemetry**: Centralized logging, Elk, Grafana, Prometheus
    * **Operating Systems**: At home in linux or windows
