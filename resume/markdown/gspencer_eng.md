    * Bootstrapped a multi-account AWS configuration from scratch with full infrastructure-as-code (terraform)
       * Seemlessly assimulated legacy pre-merger AWS accounts, and transferred workloads between accounts and regions
    * Lead multi-diplinary teams in converting legacy monolithic CI system(s) to a modern cloud native elastic CI system
       * Modern elastic Jenkins backed by full configuration-as-ccode and GitOps methodologies 
    * Lead an SRE team in shifting manual legacy bare metal deployments to fully automated CI/CD deployments to Kubernetes
       * Self-service and self-healing HA multi-cluster ArgoCD deployment
    * Implemented, maintained and operated a cloud native observability platform comprised of: Prometheus, grafana, alertmanager, sumologic and pagerduty
    * Implemented SSO via Okta for all mission-critical systems - from baremetal auth to internal apps to AWS to Eat Club
    * Desgined and implemented a global transit system, by utilizing AWS transit gateways to:
       * Dynamically reconfigure the global network multi-region multi-cluster kubernetes footprint with local facilities via BGP peering
       * Provide a secure intranet for employees across the country, in Singapore, France and contractors in India
    * Provided mentorship and training across the teams with respect to: architecture, CI/CD, infrastructure and networking

2013 - 2019
:   **[3Scan] - Director of Production Engineering**

	Oversaw a multi-disciplinary team of 15 - from hardware to software engineers, and biologists to product specialists - to develop a high-resolution/high-throughput 3D medical imaging system.

    * Lead a team of software engineers in designing, developing and implementing a system capable of ingesting 24GB/s of imagery
	  * Redesigned the original storage pipeline from a massive bare metal Ceph deployment to a cloud native objectstore backeend that reached a max size of 3.8PB
    * Merged a facility with the AWS cloud by executing a build out with 40Gbps of leased fiber from AWS(us-west-2) into downtown SF
      * Lead the effort for 3Scan to become officially recognized by ARIN
      * Acquire publically addressable /24 block of IPv4 space
      * Owned and operated BGP routing systems with two ISPs and AWS to route imagery into S3

4/2011 - 4/2013
:   **[Taylor Collaboration] - Engineering Intern:**

	Orthopedics bio-mechanical testing facility working with the medical industry to redesign and improve total knee and hip replacements

	* Validated the improvement of a new method for a tibial tubercle osteotomy
	* Designed a test setup to simulate humans striking their hip during falling in normal gait 

Technical Experience
--------------------

Software/System Design
:   Production ready systems should be modular, composable, reliable and operation on the principle of least surprise. 

	Extensive experience with the following:

    * **Build systems**: Bassel, Gradle, Lerna, Maven, Tox, Poetry
    * **CI/CD**: ArgoCD, AWS CodePipeline, Buildkite, CircleCI, Jenkins, GoCD, Travis
    * **Cloud Infrastructure**: All things compute, networking, storage, security, AI/ML related to AWS or GCP
    * **Configuration Management**: Ansible, Puppet, Terraform
    * **Containers/Micro-services**: Docker, Docker Swarm, ECS, Kubernetes, Mesos, Lambda, Kubeless, Severless
    * **Development Environments**: AWS Cloud9, Docker, Intellij, Vagrant
    * **IT/Networking**: Manage 3Scan's AS, BGP peering with multiple ISPs and AWS. Cisco/JunoOs you name it!
    * **Languages**: Bash, C, C++, Groovy, Java, Javascript, .Net, Node, Python, Scala, Typescript
    * **Monitoring/Telemetry**: Centralized logging, Elk, Grafana, Graphite, Prometheus, Sumologic, Splunk
    * **Operating Systems**: At home in any flavor of linux and windows
    * **Testing**: Junit, PyTest, ScalaTest
    * **Version Control**: Git, Github, Gitlab, Phabricator

Engineering Management
