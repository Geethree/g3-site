Experience
----------
2022 - Present
:   **[Cruise] - Staff Site Reliability Engineer Technical Lead Manager (TLM)**

    As Staff Site Reliability Engineer TLM at Cruise, I spearheaded a team of six in designing, implementing and operating Cruise's declarative release and deployment platform. Key achievements include:

    - Developed and implemented an advanced release attestation packaging system, reducing deployment times by 40%.
    - Established a deployment pipeline governance framework, enhancing deployment accuracy by 30% and compliance by 25%.
    - Integrated real-time monitoring and automated quality checks.
    - Launched a centralized user interface, boosting deployment efficiency by 35%.
    - Created command-line tools, accelerating deployment actions by 50%.

2021 - 2022
:   **[Skydio] - Staff Engineer - Infrastructure/Site Reliability**

    At Skydio, I led a team in transforming the enterprise autonomous drone platform’s infrastructure, supporting 200 engineers. Key accomplishments include:

    - Migrated legacy build system from custom cmake to bazel.
    - Established an effective Incident Management process and on-call systems, enhancing service reliability.
    - Integrated Kubernetes into the development lifecycle, optimizing deployment and application management.
    - Transitioned to manual legacy deployments to automated container-based deployments, reducing deployment time from 2 hours to 15 minutes.
    - Upgraded Continuous Integration system to handle 5000 daily builds across 2500 ephemeral workers, supported by a custom Python-based management platform.

2013 - 2021
:   **[Strateos] - Director of Infrastructure**

    At Strateos, I spearheaded the expansion and modernization of robotic cloud drug discovery labs across two continents, growing from one to four facilities. My notable contributions include:

    - Collaborated with the Product team to create an infrastructure roadmap for growth.
    - Achieved a 13x reduction in build times by overhauling legacy build systems, accelerating feature development.
    - Initiated a multi-account AWS configuration using Terraform, enhancing workload transfer across regions.
    - Led teams in transitioning CI systems to a cloud-native, elastic framework and automating CI/CD deployments to Kubernetes, improving deployment efficiency.
    - Implemented a comprehensive cloud-native observability platform and established SSO via Okta for critical systems.
    - Designed and implemented a global transit network, optimizing multi-region, multi-cluster Kubernetes setups.
    - Provided mentorship in architecture, CI/CD, infrastructure, and networking, advancing Strateos’s digital cloud lab technology.

Technical Experience
--------------------

Software/System Design
:   Production ready systems should be modular, composable, reliable and operation on the principle of least surprise. 

	Extensive experience with the following:

    * **Build systems**: Bazel, CMake, Gradle, Lerna, Maven, Tox, Poetry
    * **CI/CD**: ArgoCD, AWS CodePipeline, Buildkite, CircleCI, Jenkins, Github Actions, GoCD, Tekton, Travis
    * **Cloud Infrastructure**: All things compute, networking, storage, security, AI/ML related to AWS or GCP
    * **Configuration Management**: Ansible, Puppet, Terraform
    * **Containers/Micro-services**: Docker, ECS, jib, Kubernetes, Lambda, KNative, Kubeless
    * **Development Environments**: AWS Cloud9, Docker, Eclipse Che, Gitpod, Intellij, Vagrant
    * **Edge Computing**: Akri, Balena Cloud, ioFog, AWS Greengrass, AWS IOT Core
    * **Identity Management**: Active Directory, Okta
    * **IT/Networking**: Managed 3Scan's AS, BGP peering with multiple ISPs and AWS. Cisco/JunoOS you name it!
    * **Languages**: Bash, Python, Java, Go, Javascript, .Net, Node, Python, Scala, Typescript
    * **Observability**: ELK, Grafana, Prometheus, Sumologic, Splunk
