Technical Experience
--------------------

Software/System Design
:   Production ready systems should be modular, composable, reliable and operation on the principle of least surprise. 

	Extensive experience with the following:

    * **Build systems**: Bassel, Gradle, Lerna, Maven, Tox, Poetry
    * **CI/CD**: ArgoCD, AWS CodePipeline, Buildkite, CircleCI, Jenkins, GoCD, Travis
    * **Cloud Infrastructure**: All things compute, networking, storage, security, AI/ML related to AWS or GCP
    * **Configuration Management**: Ansible, Puppet, Terraform
    * **Containers/Micro-services**: Docker, Docker Swarm, ECS, Kubernetes, Mesos, Lambda, Kubeless, Severless
    * **Development Environments**: AWS Cloud9, Docker, Intellij, Vagrant
    * **IT/Networking**: Manage 3Scan's AS, BGP peering with multiple ISPs and AWS. Cisco/JunoOs you name it!
    * **Languages**: Bash, C, C++, Groovy, Java, Javascript, .Net, Node, Python, Scala, Typescript
    * **Monitoring/Telemetry**: Centralized logging, Elk, Grafana, Graphite, Prometheus, Sumologic, Splunk
    * **Operating Systems**: At home in any flavor of linux and windows
    * **Testing**: Junit, PyTest, ScalaTest
    * **Version Control**: Git, Github, Gitlab, Phabricator

Engineering Management
:   Engineering is fundamentally a creative task, and the job of a strong Leader is to maximize people's ability to get the thing they want to do done.

    * **Agile methodologies**: Applied to both software and hardware
    * **Project management**: From gantt charts and QFDs to task management, OKRs and KPIs
    * The customer experience is key, dog-fooding is a must
    * Have overseen complex multi-disciplinary teams from 2 to 15 engineers
    * Deeply enjoy seeding an engineering culture that will meet the future organization needs
