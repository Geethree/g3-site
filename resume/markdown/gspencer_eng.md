:   **[Skydio] - Engineering Manager - Infrastructure/Site Reliability**

	Leading a small team architecting, designing and operating the infrastructure and processes required to support Skydio's enterprise autonomous drone platform and the 150 engineers working on the platform.

    * Architected and implemented a complete revamp of Skydio's AWS deployment in support of SOC I/II
       * Transitioned from one legacy account to an AWS organization with full SAML support for users
       * Implemented a scalable transit system to ensure secure private communication between all of Skydio's networks
    * Implemented an Incident Management process and on-call systems for external and internal customers
    * Championed the introduction of Kubernetes into the development lifecycle
       * Developed a Bazel & jsonnet based manifest generation library
    * Uplifted legacy deployments of external services to automated highly available container based deployments
       * Reduced time to deploy from 2 hours to 15 minutes
       * Automated deployments with instantaneous rollbacks
    * Revamped Continuous integration systems to scale to 5000 builds a day across 2500 ephemeral workers
    * Introduced a Continuous Deployment platform leveraged by every software team at Skydio to self service repeatable / reliable deployments

2019 - 2021
:   **[Strateos] - Director of Infrastructure**

	Designing, developing, implementing and operating the robotic cloud drug discovery labs of the future.

    * Actively worked with Product to strategically develop the Eng.Org's infrastructure roadmap to meet future growth targets
       * One facility to four facilities across two continents
    * Revamped legacy build systems:
       * Decreased build times by 13x and drastically increased the org's feature velocity
    * Bootstrapped a multi-account AWS configuration from scratch with full infrastructure-as-code (terraform)
       * Seemlessly assimulated legacy pre-merger AWS accounts, and transferred workloads between accounts and regions
    * Lead multi-diplinary teams in converting legacy monolithic CI system(s) to a modern cloud native elastic CI system
       * Modern elastic Jenkins backed by full configuration-as-ccode and GitOps methodologies 
    * Lead an SRE team in shifting manual legacy bare metal deployments to fully automated CI/CD deployments to Kubernetes
       * Self-service and self-healing HA multi-cluster ArgoCD deployment
    * Implemented, maintained and operated a cloud native observability platform comprised of: Prometheus, grafana, alertmanager, sumologic and pagerduty
    * Implemented SSO via Okta for all mission-critical systems - from baremetal auth to internal apps to AWS to Eat Club
    * Desgined and implemented a global transit system, by utilizing AWS transit gateways to:
       * Dynamically reconfigure the global network multi-region multi-cluster kubernetes footprint with local facilities via BGP peering
       * Provide a secure intranet for employees across the country, in Singapore, France and contractors in India
    * Provided mentorship and training across the teams with respect to: architecture, CI/CD, infrastructure and networking

2013 - 2019
:   **[3Scan] - Director of Production Engineering**

	Oversaw a multi-disciplinary team of 15 - from hardware to software engineers, and biologists to product specialists - to develop a high-resolution/high-throughput 3D medical imaging system.

    * Lead a team of software engineers in designing, developing and implementing a system capable of ingesting 24GB/s of imagery
	  * Redesigned the original storage pipeline from a massive bare metal Ceph deployment to a cloud native objectstore backeend that reached a max size of 3.8PB
    * Merged a facility with the AWS cloud by executing a build out with 40Gbps of leased fiber from AWS(us-west-2) into downtown SF
      * Lead the effort for 3Scan to become officially recognized by ARIN
      * Acquire publically addressable /24 block of IPv4 space
      * Owned and operated BGP routing systems with two ISPs and AWS to route imagery into S3

Technical Experience
--------------------

Software/System Design
:   Production ready systems should be modular, composable, reliable and operation on the principle of least surprise.
